                in
                the area, are
                similarly distressed as they can't contact their loved ones. Social media is swamped with posts from
                worried users seeking any update about their stranded loved ones or any information of rescue attempts.

                moved to the first

                been disconnected, thanks to the power outage that engulfed not just the hospital, but the entire Sylhet
                district.</p>
